# NPC Discord Bot

## Introduction

Welcome to the NPC Discord Bot! This bot is built on top of Langchain and allows you to create, load, save, and upload character personas for chatbots in a Discord server. These personas can be used to guide conversations like a game, customize character information, or tweak generated personas. The NPC Discord Bot is designed to be easy to use and customize through a tuning_variables file. No coding experience is required to use this bot, but if you want to extend its functionality, you can do so through Replit's bounty system or by asking for help in the Adim Arcade discord.

## How to use the NPC Discord Bot in Discord

Before you can use the bot in Discord, make sure it is properly set up and connected to your server. Once it's ready, you can use the following slash commands to interact with the bot:

- `/loadcharacterpersona`: Load a character persona from the data directory.
- `/savecharacterpersona`: Save the current character persona to a local file.
- `/uploadcharacterpersona`: Upload a character persona text file.
- `/say`: Send a message to the bot and wait for its response.
- `/restartbot`: Restart the bot instance.

Please note that some commands require administrator permissions.

Here's a quick overview of how to use each command:

### Load a Character Persona

To load a character persona, use the `/loadcharacterpersona` command followed by the name of the persona you want to load. If you want to generate a new character persona, use "Generate New Character Persona" as the name.

### Save a Character Persona

To save a character persona, use the `/savecharacterpersona` command followed by the desired filename. The bot will save the current character persona to a local file with the specified name.

### Upload a Character Persona

To upload a character persona, use the `/uploadcharacterpersona` command and attach a text file containing the character persona data. The bot will save the uploaded persona and update its cache of available character personas.

### Send a Message to the Bot

To send a message to the bot, use the `/say` command followed by your message. The bot will process your message and respond accordingly. Keep in mind that there is a limit of 2 responses in the queue at any given time.

### Restart the Bot Instance

To restart the bot instance, use the `/restartbot` command. This command can be helpful if you encounter issues with the bot or want to reset its state.

## Extending the NPC Discord Bot

If you have an idea for extending the functionality of the NPC Discord Bot, you can use Replit's bounty system to pay other programmers a nominal amount to implement your desired features. This is a great way for those without coding skills to bring their ideas to life. Additionally, you can request help in the Adim Arcade discord to draft bounties for extension, which can be a great way to collaborate with others and make your NPC Discord Bot even better!


In the following sections, you will learn more about Replit and how to set up your Discord bot to further customize and enhance its capabilities. Explore the possibilities and unleash your creativity to create a unique and engaging NPC Discord bot experience!

# NPC-Framework Guide

## Overview

This framework provides a foundation for building chatbots using Langchain. You can create chatbot personas by defining their "personas," which are sets of instructions for a conversation, custom character information, or tweaks to generated personas. It is designed for use with Discord bots and allows you to load, upload, generate, and save character personas. The main class for users to interact with is `NPCAgent`.

## Agent Class, Agent Brain, and NPCAgent

The framework consists of three main classes, `BaseAgent`, `AgentBrain`, and `NPCAgent`.

### BaseAgent

The `BaseAgent` class is the base class for all agents. To create an agent subclass, inherit from `BaseAgent` and override the `Load` method. Agents are composed of any number of 'Brains' which are basic Agents with a single 'toolkit' and 'prompt'. Agents have a single 'Master Brain' which is the brain that is used to execute the Agent, which is used alone or to coordinate and use other brains as 'Tools'. We use the 'Master' prefix to denote the values that get passed to the Master Brain.

#### Key Functions

- `load_master_index_and_tools`: Loads the Index, Index Manager, and Toolkit for the Master Brain.
- `ConstructBrain`: Constructs a Brain. Set the `ismaster` flag to true to set the Master Brain values to the brain you construct.
- `load`: Creates the master agent with loaded master values. Ensure `load_master_index_and_tools` is called first.
- `make_persona_sheet_extract_agent`: Creates a Data Extract Brain for persona sheets.
- `make_entity_extract_agent`: Creates a Data Extract Brain for entities.
- `async_query_master_brain`: Asynchronously queries the Master Brain.

### AgentBrain

The `AgentBrain` class is responsible for creating an LLMChain instance and provides a method for asynchronously querying the LLM.

#### Key Functions

- `create_LLM_Chain`: Creates an LLMChain instance for the AgentBrain.
- `async_query`: Asynchronously queries the LLM.
- `format_intermediate_steps`: Extracts intermediate steps from the AgentBrain's thought process string.
- `construct_agent_executor`: Creates an AgentExecutor instance for the AgentBrain.

### NPCAgent

The `NPCAgent` class is a subclass of `BaseAgent` and serves as the main class for users to interact with when creating chatbot personas. It has a single sub-brain, the 'extraction brain', which collects character sheet information from a Vector Store Index (`GPTSimpleVectorIndex`) at a directory, constructs a summary of that information, and adds it to the prompt.

#### Key Functions

- `__init__`: Initializes the NPCAgent instance with required parameters.
- `make_npc_agent`: Makes an NPC agent with character sheet and name.
- `load`: Asynchronously loads the NPC agent with the character sheet.

## How to Use

1. Import the necessary classes and modules.
2. Create an instance of the `NPCAgent` class.
3. Call the `load` method to asynchronously load the NPC agent with the character sheet.
4. Use the `async_query_master_brain` method to send queries to the Master Brain.

## Ideas for Extending

- Implement a web-based interface for creating and managing personas.
- Create a variety of pre-built personas for different contexts and industries.
- Integrate with other chat platforms beyond Discord.
- Develop a method for importing/exporting personas between users.
- Add additional tools and prompts for more diverse and dynamic conversations.
